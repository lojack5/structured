Welcome to structured's documentation!
======================================

The structured library aims to make it easier to write code to read and write
complex data files.  Reading a data file created by a C program with a well
defined structure?  structured may be for you.

The project is still in development, so it may not have all the features you
need.  You may even find bugs.  Please do visit the issue tracker if you want to
request a feature or report a bug.

Basic information:

* Supported environments:  Currently tests run on
  - Python: 3.9, 3.10 (CPython)
  - Windows, macOS, Linux

  Newer Python versions or systems might also work; let us know your experience.

* Install: ``pip install -U structured-classes``.  Structured is a source only
  library, so no compilation needed.
