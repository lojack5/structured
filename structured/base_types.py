"""
Base types for all types that are handled by the Structured class.

    structured_type: The base class for every type handled by Structured.
    format_type: The base class for classes with direct correlation to static
        format strings.
    counted: A subclass of format_type that allows for specifying a count,
        specifically for 's', 'p', and 'x' format specifiers.
    Serializer: A protocol for more complex types.  To define a custom
        serializer, you should subclass from both structured_type and
        Serializer.

Serializer API:

A serializer has almost the same API as the struct.Struct class.  It must
provide the following methods and attributes:

    unpack(buffer: byteslike) -> tuple
        - Unpacks from a bytes-like buffer, returning a tuple of objects to be
          assigned to the associated attributes. NOTE: unlike struct.Struct,
          unpack must support unpacking from buffers that are *longer* than
          are required for the packed data.
    unpack_from(buffer: BufferProtocol, offset: int = 0) -> tuple
        - Like unpack, but from an object supporting the Buffer Protocol.
    unpack_read(readable: SupportsRead) -> tuple
        - Like `unpack`, but reads in data from an objects with a `.read` method
          returning bytes.

    pack(*values) -> bytes
        - Packs the given values into bytes.
    pack_into(buffer: BufferProtocol, offset: int, *values) -> None
        - Like pack, but places the packed bytes into the Buffer Protocol
          supporting buffer, beginning at offset.
    pack_write(writable: SupportsWrite) -> None
        - Like `pack`, but writes the data into an object with a `.write` method
          taking bytes.

    size
        - A (possibly dynamic) attribute that represents the size the associated
          object's packed/unpacked data.  This attribute must be up to date with
          the most recently called of:
            - unpack
            - unpack_from
            - pack_into
          This is to support dynamically sized packing/unpacking.
